# OAuth_Authentication_Flow_With_Fiddler

# Description

OAuth is an open standard to grant access to Application or Websites to their information without providing them password. Oauth uses JWT (JSON Web token) in encrypted form to exchange tokens between serivce provider and resource owner.

To illustrate the authorization and authentication flow, I have chosen LinkedIn as Service provider(sp) and Facebook as Identity provider(idp). The motive is to identify the redirections and to understand the authentication flow with Fiddler in action.
