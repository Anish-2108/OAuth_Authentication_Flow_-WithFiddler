# OAuth_Authentication_Flow_With_Fiddler

# Description

OAuth is an open standard to grant access to Application or Websites to their information without providing them password. 

To illustrate the authorization and authentication flow, I have chosen LinkedIn as Service provider(sp) and Facebook as Identity provider(idp). The motive is to identify the redirections and to understand the authentication with Fiddler in action.
